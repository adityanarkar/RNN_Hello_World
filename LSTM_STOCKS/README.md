## LSTM_STOCKS

Here, I am using LSTM model to train the stocks. I have collected the stock's data [here](https://in.finance.yahoo.com/quote/TITAN.NS/history?period1=1205557200&period2=1552626000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d).

Completed:

1. Created a target feature.

TODO:
1. Develop the LSTM model.
2. Test the model in real world trading scenario.
3. Post the results.
4. Modify the features and perform the tests.
5. Fiddle around with SEQUENCE_SIZE and FUTURE_PERIOD_PREDICT.
