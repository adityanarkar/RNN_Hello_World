## RNN

RNN is useful when the order of the data carries significance.

Each unit will be having:

1. Forget gate f
2. Input gate i
3. Output gate o
4. Cell c

Each gate regulates the flow of information on the Cell.

Working of a unit:

1. Data comes in through a previous unit
2. Forget gate decides what to forget from the received data through previous unit
3. Input gate decides what to add
4. Ouput gate decides what to ouput from this unit
